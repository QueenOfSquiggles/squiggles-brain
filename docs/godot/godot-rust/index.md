# Godot Rust Knowledge Base

Godot Rust is a tool system which allows you to create GDExtension libraries for Godot through rather clever FFI interactions using rust. It's a wonderful world where memory is managed and macros are king!

While there is a version available for Godot 3.X versions, I (QueenOfSquiggles) highly favor the Godot 4 versions. Especially 4.2 since `reloadable = true` is available to hot reload extensions currently in development
